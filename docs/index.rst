Welcome to LSTOSA's documentation!
==================================

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

LSTOSA is the *On-Site Analysis* system of LST.
These docs try to create and organize the missing documentation for LSTOSA.

It also introduces a documentation of the API.
For the python part of LSTOSA, we use the `autodoc` extension of Sphinx, which
pulls in the documentation from the docstrings.
